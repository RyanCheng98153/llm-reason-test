            "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given these three logarithmic equations with variables x, y, and z. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then I have to find m + n. Alright, let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives three equations involving logarithms base 2 of ratios of x, y, z. The equations are:\n\n1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2\n2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3\n3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²). Hmm, okay. Let me think. Since all the equations are logarithms base 2, maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make the equations easier to handle. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the equations using logarithm properties. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me recall that log₂(A) = B is equivalent to 2^B = A. So, maybe converting each equation into its exponential form will help me get expressions for x/(y z), y/(x z), and z/(x y). Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2 ⇒ x/(y z) = 2^(1/2) = √2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\n2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3 ⇒ y/(x z) = 2^(1/3).\n\nThird equation:\n\n3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4 ⇒ z/(x y) = 2^(1/4).\n\nHmm, so now we have three equations:\n\n1. x/(y z) = √2,\n\n2. y/(x z) = 2^(1/3),\n\n3. z/(x y) = 2^(1/4).\n\nThese are three equations with three variables. Maybe I can solve for x, y, z in terms of each other and then find their values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others and then substitute. Let me see. Let me denote the three equations as (1), (2), (3) respectively.\n\nLet me see if I can multiply these equations together in some way to get a relationship between x, y, z. Let me think. Let's see, if I multiply all three left-hand sides together and set that equal to the product of the right-hand sides.\n\nSo, multiplying equation 1, 2, 3:\n\nLeft-hand sides: [x/(y z)] * [y/(x z)] * [z/(x y)].\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nMultiply numerators: x * y * z,\n\nMultiply denominators: (y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y.\n\nLet me compute denominator terms:\n\nFirst term denominator: y*z,\n\nSecond term denominator: x*z,\n\nThird term denominator: x*y,\n\nMultiplying all denominators: (y*z)*(x*z)*(x*y) = x² y² z².\n\nSo the entire product of the left-hand sides is (x * y * z) / (x² y² z²) ) = 1/(x y z).\n\nThe right-hand sides multiplied together: √2 * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4).\n\nSince they're all powers of 2, we can add exponents:\n\n√2 is 2^(1/2), so total exponent is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.\n\nLet me compute that exponent:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let's find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total exponent: (6 + 4 + 3)/12 = 13/12. So right-hand side product is 2^(13/12).\n\nTherefore, the product of left-hand sides equals the product of right-hand sides:\n\n1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12).\n\nTherefore, x y z = 1 / 2^(13/12) = 2^(-13/12).\n\nHmm, so that gives me the product of x, y, z. Maybe this will be helpful later.\n\nBut I need to find log₂(x⁴y³z²). Let me note that log₂(x⁴y³z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z. So if I can find log₂x, log₂y, log₂z, then I can compute this expression. Alternatively, maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of exponents and find their product raised to some power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps solving for x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me set variables for log₂x, log₂y, log₂z. Let me denote:\n\nLet a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z. Then x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c.\n\nThen, substituting into the original equations:\n\nFirst equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2.\n\nExpressed in terms of a, b, c:\n\nlog₂(x) - log₂(y z) = a - (log₂y + log₂z) = a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\nlog₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3 ⇒ b - (a + c) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4 ⇒ c - (a + b) = 1/4.\n\nSo now, I have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2,\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, first equation is a - (b + c) = 1/2 ⇒ a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nSecond equation is b - (a + c) = 1/3 ⇒ b - a - c = 1/3 ⇒ -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\nThird equation is c - (a + b) = 1/4 ⇒ c - a - b = 1/4 ⇒ -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nYes, that's correct. So now, the system is:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nSo now, three equations with three variables a, b, c. Let me write them down again:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2,\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see if I can solve this system. Let me try to add equations to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, perhaps adding equations 1 and 2:\n\nEquation1 + Equation2: (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = (1/2) + (1/3).\n\nLeft side: a - a - b + b - c - c = -2c,\n\nRight side: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6.\n\nTherefore: -2c = 5/6 ⇒ c = -5/12.\n\nWait, but hold on, c is log₂z, so z is 2^c. But since z is a positive real number, that's okay even if c is negative. But let me see if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again:\n\nEquation1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation2: -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\nAdding them:\n\n(a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3,\n\nWhich gives 0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6,\n\nSo -2c = 5/6 ⇒ c = -5/(12). Yes, that's right. So c = -5/12.\n\nOkay, so that gives us c = -5/12. Now, let's see if we can find a and b.\n\nSimilarly, let's try adding equations 1 and 3:\n\nEquation1 + Equation3: (a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/4.\n\nLeft side: a - a - b - b + (-c + c) = -2b,\n\nRight side: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4,\n\nTherefore, -2b = 3/4 ⇒ b = -3/8.\n\nWait, let's check again:\n\nEquation1: a - b - c,\n\nEquation3: -a - b + c,\n\nAdding them:\n\n(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = -2b,\n\nYes, so -2b = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 ⇒ b = -3/(8). Okay, so b = -3/8.\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same with equations 2 and 3:\n\nEquation2 + Equation3: (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4,\n\nLeft side: -a - a + b - b + (-c + c) = -2a,\n\nRight side: 7/12,\n\nThus, -2a = 7/12 ⇒ a = -7/24.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nEquation2: -a + b - c,\n\nEquation3: -a - b + c,\n\nAdding them: (-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = -2a,\n\nSo, -2a = 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12 ⇒ a = -7/24.\n\nWait, so a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nHmm, so that gives me a, b, c. Let me verify if these values satisfy all three equations.\n\nLet me check equation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-7/24 + 3/8 + 5/12.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = (-7 + 9 +10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2. Which matches equation1.\n\nGood.\n\nEquation2: -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 7/24 - 3/8 + 5/12.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3, which is correct.\n\nEquation3: -a - b + c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12.\n\nConvert to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Wait, 7 +9 -10 = 6, so 6/24 = 1/4. Wait, 6/24 is 1/4? 6/24 is 1/4? Wait 6/24 is 1/4? Wait 6 divided by 24 is 1/4? No, 6/24 is 1/4? Wait 24 divided by 6 is 4, so 6/24 is 1/4. Yes, correct. So that gives 1/4, which matches equation3. So that's correct.\n\nOkay, so the values a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nTherefore, since a = log₂x, so x = 2^a,\n\nSimilarly, y = 2^b,\n\nz = 2^c.\n\nTherefore, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nWait, yes! Because log₂(x⁴y³z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nTherefore, we can compute 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nSo substituting a, b, c:\n\na = -7/24,\n\nb = -3/8,\n\nc = -5/12.\n\nSo:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nFirst, let me convert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24,\n\nTotal sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nTherefore, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -75/24.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value of this, so | -75/24 | = 75/24.\n\nSimplify 75/24: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 25/8. Wait, 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So 75/24 = 25/8. Wait, but 25 and 8 are coprime. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m = 25, n =8, so m +n = 33. Wait, but hold on. Wait, let me check my calculation again because I might have messed up.\n\nWait, let me recalculate 4a + 3b + 2c:\n\nFirst, 4a: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3b: 3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2c: 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6,\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n-28/24 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-28/24 - (9/8)*(3/3) = -27/24,\n\n-5/6*(4/4) = -20/24,\n\nSo total: -28 -27 -20 over 24:\n\n28 +27 is 55, plus 20 is 75, so total numerator: -75, so -75/24. So that's correct. Then absolute value is 75/24, which reduces to 25/8 (divided numerator and denominator by 3). 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So 25/8. Therefore, the absolute value is 25/8, so m =25, n=8, which are coprime. Thus m +n is 33.\n\nWait, so is that the answer? Wait, but let me confirm once again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute x⁴y³z² directly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if I interpreted the equations correctly.\n\nWait, let me check again the equations for a, b, c.\n\nWait, the first equation was log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2, so log₂x - log₂y - log₂z =1/2 ⇒ a - b -c =1/2, which we had. So that's correct. Similarly, the second equation gives -a + b - c =1/3,\n\nThird equation gives -a -b + c =1/4,\n\nSo solving those gives a, b, c as above, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the value of log₂(x⁴y³z²) again:\n\nlog₂(x⁴y³z²) =4a +3b +2c,\n\nSo substituting the values:\n\na = -7/24,\n\nb= -3/8,\n\nc= -5/12,\n\nSo:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3*(-3/8)= -9/8,\n\n2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6,\n\nAdding them: -28/24 -9/8 -5/6,\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24,\n\nThus, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -75/24,\n\nTherefore the absolute value is 75/24, which reduces to 25/8, so 25/8 is in lowest terms, so m +n =25+8=33. Hmm, so that would be the answer.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to get there, maybe through exponents?\n\nAlternatively, since we know a, b, c, perhaps we can compute x, y, z individually and plug into x⁴y³z², but that might be more work, but let's see:\n\nx = 2^a =2^{-7"
